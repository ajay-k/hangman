Hangman is a game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**. It generates a random word for the user to solve. The user guesses letters to solve the word using the keyboard displayed on screen. This project was made to get a grasp of DOM manipulation along with learning CSS transitions.

*Converts randomly generated word to **uppercase** letters

*Finds the location of the letter and places it in correct position on wordbank

*Handles **repetitive** letters in word

*Correct letter pops up above selected keyboard button and animated to correct placement on wordbank
